# Amytis Saghafi

Systems and embedded engineering student with hands-on experience in **hardware–software integration**, **embedded Linux development**, and **digital systems design**.  
My work focuses on low-level C programming, GPIO-level hardware interaction, FPGA-based architectures, and building reliable systems through careful bring-up, debugging, and documentation.

I am especially interested in embedded systems, real-time software, and system-level engineering roles.

## Featured Projects

**[🔐 Home Security System](https://github.com/amytis25/Home_Security_System)**  
https://github.com/amytis25/Home_Security_System  
Distributed embedded Linux security system built on BeagleY-AI with real-time peripheral monitoring and control.  
My contributions focused on hardware bring-up, GPIO-level access in C, enclosure design, and centralized system documentation to support integration and debugging.

**[🧠 Execution Unit Design (VHDL)](https://github.com/amytis25/Execution_Unit_Design)**  
https://github.com/amytis25/Digital_Systems_Design  
Configurable 64-bit execution unit implemented in VHDL, including arithmetic, logic, and shifting subsystems.  
Explores carry-handling strategies, timing behavior, and performance–resource trade-offs through simulation and synthesis.

**[🎮 Force Cube Runner](https://github.com/amytis25/Force_Cube_Runner)**  
https://github.com/amytis25/Force_Cube_Runner  
3D obstacle-avoidance game built in Python and OpenGL with optional Arduino-based hardware controls.  
Demonstrates hardware–software integration, real-time sensor input, and a complete, well-documented system from prototype to demo.

**[✋ ASL Translator](https://github.com/amytis25/ASL-Translator)**  
https://github.com/amytis25/ASL-Translator  
Real-time American Sign Language letter recognition system using computer vision and machine learning.  
Implemented live hand tracking and visual overlays in Python using OpenCV and MediaPipe.
