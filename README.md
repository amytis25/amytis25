## Hi, I'm Amytis

I'm a systems-focused engineering student with a strong interest in embedded systems, hardware–software integration, and low-level system design.

I build projects across:
- Embedded Linux and microcontroller-based systems
- Digital design and hardware description languages (VHDL)
- C/C++ systems programming and foundational CS concepts
- Applied computer vision and data-driven systems

### Featured Projects
- **Embedded Home Security System** — Distributed embedded Linux system using BeagleY-AI boards, sensors, actuators, and UDP communication  
- **Execution Unit Design (VHDL)** — Modular execution unit exploring architectural trade-offs, validated in Quartus and ModelSim  
- **ASL Translator** — Real-time computer vision system for ASL letter recognition using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe  

### Technical Focus
- C, C++, Python
- Embedded Linux, GPIO, PWM, I2C, SPI, UART
- VHDL, digital logic, simulation and verification
- System-level debugging and integration
